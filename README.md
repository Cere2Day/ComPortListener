This program is used to receive data via a serial port (.net-components) and to do something with it defined in an ini file

With default code the received input is used to be opened via a hidden cmd in the webbrowser.

Codes is probably not that great but it's working. Have fun with it.

Program starts hidden in systray and logs received data in textbox in gui.
